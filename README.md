# diamond-price-prediction-R
Predicting diamonds price with the Diamonds data set on kaggle using linear regression



## Introduction
Purpose of this project is to implement machine learning algorithms on a real data set. Visualization and exploration of the dataset and data preparation are also the important parts of this project.

## Understanding the Data
Name of the dataset that has been used in this project is 'Diamonds' (https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds). This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. Aim of the project is to implement machine learning models to predict the price of the diamonds.

### Description for each attribute
price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x length in mm (0--10.74)

y width in mm (0--58.9)

z depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)

## Results

Mean Absolute Error: 402

R2: 0.9764
